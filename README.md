# SimpleOfflineMap
Project reheated originated from https://myembeddeddiary.wordpress.com/2016/08/18/building-offline-maps-in-qt-without-any-servertile-server-direct-offline-map-using-file-protocol/

In the blog, the author shared his project code in google drive and the OSM data was set to his local PC directory. I download the code and "fork" it to my repo so that may help others.

Thanks to the Author
